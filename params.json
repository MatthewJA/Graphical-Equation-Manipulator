Incorporates [MatthewJA]/**[Coffeequate]**.\r\n\r\nManipulate physics equations in an intuitive, visual manner.\r\n\r\n## Basic Instructions\r\nGreen equations can be equated and solved. Blue equations can have green equations substituted into them, and represent solutions.\r\n\r\nDouble click a green variable to solve the equation for that variable. Drag between two green variables to equate them. Drag a green variable into an equivalent blue variable to substitute the green equation into the blue one. Right click a variable to set its value, or construct it from other variables.\r\n\r\n[BuckShlegeris]: https://github.com/BuckShlegeris\r\n[Graphical-Equation-Manipulator]: https://github.com/BuckShlegeris/Graphical-equation-manipulator\r\n[MatthewJA]: https://github.com/MatthewJA\r\n[Coffeequate]: https://github.com/MatthewJA/Coffeequate\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
