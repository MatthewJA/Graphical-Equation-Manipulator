title: Graphical Equation Manipulator
---
# Physics problems, made easier.
The average physics student makes one algebra mistake per four lines of working. That'll be a problem when you realise it in an hour or so.

Enter the Graphical Equation Manipulator.

GEM is a program which assists in solving simple physics problems. Visually manipulate equations, automatically propagate uncertainties, substitute values and ensure dimensions match up.

## Features
* Drag and drop equations onto the screen.
* Equate different variables and quickly solve sets of equations.
* Propagate uncertainties.
* Substitute values.

## Usage
GEM is in pre-alpha right now, so there's no released builds as yet. There is, however, a demo [here](/gem/).

## Upcoming Features
* Calculus.
* Output PyLab code for plotting equations.
* Better handling of units.
* Bug fixes. Bug fixes are features!
